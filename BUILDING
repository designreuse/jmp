                 Building JavaMail Pages Tag Library (JMP)
                 =========================================

This project contains the source code for JavaMail Pages Tag Library (JMP).
In order to build a binary distribution version of the application from
a source distribution, do the following:


(1) Download and Install Java SE SDK

  If the JDK is already installed, skip to (2).

  Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.5.x or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/javase/

  Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

  Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory where your JDK
  is installed. The JDK functionalities of Apache Ant (such as javac task)
  will need this variable to find tools.jar file of your JDK.

(2) Download and Install Java EE SDK

  If the Java EE SDK is already installed, skip to (3).

  Download Java EE 5 SDK release from:

    http://java.sun.com/javaee/

  Install Java EE 5 SDK.

(3) Download and Install Apache Ant 1.7.x

  If Apache Ant 1.7.x is already installed, skip to (4).

  Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.7.x from:

    http://ant.apache.org/

  Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location. It's
  recommended that Apache Ant resides in its own directory (for example
  "apache-ant-1.7.x").

  Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the directory where you installed
  Ant. The directory will be known as ANT_HOME in the remainder of this
  document.

  Add the ANT_HOME/bin directory to your PATH environment variable. This
  makes the ant wrapper scripts available.


(4) Download and Install Tag Library Documentation Generator 1.3

  If Tag Library Documentation Generator 1.3 is already installed, skip
  to (5).

  Download a binary distribution of Tag Library Documentation Generator 1.3
  from:

    https://taglibrarydoc.dev.java.net/

  Unpack the distribution into a convenient location. It's recommended that
  it resides in its own directory (for example "taglibrarydoc-1_3").


(5) Building

(5.1) Customize Build Properties

  There are two build properties files provided with the source distribution,
  "build.properties" and "build.properties.sample". The former is
  the main build properties used by build.xml, and need no customization
  for the user's local environment; the later is not used by build.xml, and
  intended to be used as a sample to make customization for the user's local
  environment.

  Create a "build.properties" in your home directory. Copy contents in
  "build.properties.sample" to it, and make appropriate customization
  for your local environment.
  
  At most environment, You MUST do this customization to make a successful
  building. 

(5.2) Building

  Go to that directory, and do:

    ant

(5.3) For NetBeans IDE Users

  The source distribution of this project contains two projects under the
  taglib and examples folder for NetBeans IDE 6.9.1. It's recommended to
  work with these projects in the NetBeans IDE.
