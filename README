                     JavaMail Pages Tag Library (JMP)
                     ================================

Thanks for using JavaMail Pages Tag Library (JMP), a tag library based on
JavaMail API, and used for building JSP-based templates of JavaMail messages.

(1) Using the Tag Library

  To use tag library with your own web applications, simply copy the JAR
  files in the 'lib' directory (javaplus-jmp.jar)to your application's
  WEB-INF/lib directory. Then, import the template tag library into your
  pages with the following directives:

    <%@ taglib prefix="m" uri="http://www.javaplus.org/jmp" %>

  or introducing a new namespace with the above URI in a JSP document
  in XML syntax.

(2) Rumtime Dependencies

  This version of JMP has the following runtime dependencies provided
  by Java EE containers:

    - JavaMail 1.4
    - Servlet 2.4
    - JSP 2.0
    - JSTL 1.2 (needed by example web application)

(3) WAR Files

  The following file is a standalone web application (WAR) in order to help
  you to learn and use JMP. Deploy the application to your container, and
  follow the examples to familiarize yourself with the usage of JMP.

   jmp-examples.war            Example application of JMP usage

(4) Documentation

  See documentation in 'docs/' directory for more information.

(5) Building from Source Code

  Download a source distribution. See BUILDING for the information about
  how to build JMP from the source code.
